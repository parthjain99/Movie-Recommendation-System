# Movie-Recommendation-System
Recommender systems, which have been widely implemented by
many online businesses, social media sites, play a critical role in
easing information overload in the age of information explosion.
Speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing have all benefited greatly from deep neural networks. The use of
deep neural networks in recommender systems, on the other hand,
has gotten less attention. For this, we strive to develop a movie
recommendation system on ’MovieLens’ dataset using techniques
based on neural networks i.e Neural Collaborative Filtering. We
have developed a couple of baseline models such as SVDpp and
KNN too along with the Deep Neural network model inorder to
test our main model. Each model’s hyperparameter tuning, testing
accuracy, evaluation on different parameters and review of recommendations are meticulously carried out. The study includes a
detailed analysis of each model.
